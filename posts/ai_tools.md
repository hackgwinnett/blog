# Hello everyone!

I hope the school year has gotten off to an amazing start for you.

Our [**last post**](https://hackgwinnett.github.io/blog/posts/atlanta_startups) covered up-and-coming startups here in Atlanta. It has tons of useful advice and bits of knowledge. Make sure to check it out!

This post will focus on mind-blowing AI tools used to solve common problems. Artificial Intelligence has enabled programmers to solve difficult problems
that are otherwise unfeasible to solve with traditional programming. The majority of these tools are free and leverage cutting-edge AI technology. None
of these mentions are sponsors; I just think they are genuinely unique and useful.

## [**Uberduck**](https://uberduck.ai/)

Uberduck is not your ordinary text-to-speech application. The web-app offers thousands of different voices including your favorite rappers, twitch streamers, celebrities, and more!

Uberduck is open-source and even has a REST API so users can easily integrate it into their applications. 

## [**AI Image Enlarger**](https://imglarger.com/)

Ever had a grainy photo that you wish was clearer? AI Image Enlarger enhances the quality of images by up to eight times! It works with images of people, cartoons, and even inanimate objects. You can perform this process on a limited amount of photos for free, but you must pay after that.

## [**Magic Eraser**](https://www.magiceraser.io/)

This useful web-app removes objects from images and uses AI to automatically fill in the lost space. You can edit an unlimited number of photos completely for free and without making an account! 

## [**Thing Translator**](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/thing-translator)

Google’s “Thing Translator” combines the functionality of Google’s Cloud Vision API to identify objects and Google Translate to determine the name of that object in a certain language. Unlike many of the other items on this list, the code for this product is available online!

## [**Wordtune**](https://www.wordtune.com/)

Wordtune, to put it simply, takes a sentence and uses AI Technology to reword it. Wordtune can take casual sounding language and make it formal, or vice versa. It even has a free chrome extension and is available in several languages.

## Conclusion
These tools represent a small fraction of the AI Technology available today! As one of the fastest growing industries, AI is something to definitely look out for.
