# Hey everyone!

This post marks off the official creation of HackGwinnett’s blog. We are **super excited** to write up quirky content on everything computer science.

As this is our first post, we had to make it about Atlanta. There’s no shortage of technology buzz here, with companies like Microsoft and Google opening offices in the city.

In this article however, we won’t be talking about Atlanta’s tech giants.

We’ll be taking a close look into two Atlantan startups, GetChkd and Aetos Imaging. We interviewed Michael Caplovitz, CEO of GetChkd, and Jack Martin, Sales Manager at Aetos Imaging, to gain insight on Atlanta’s rapidly growing startup culture.

## Michael Caplovitz, CEO @ [**GetChkd**](https://www.getchkd.com/)

### 1. What is the name of your startup, and what does it do?

GetChkd Inc. is a full-suite blockchain infrastructure platform that enables Web3 - connecting the off chain to the on chain and the online to the physical world.

### 2. Why do you like to call Atlanta the home of your startup?

Atlanta is a beautiful city, with great people and great food. The city is full of really bright, interesting, passionate people that think outside the box.

### 3. How can high school or college students get involved in the startup world?

Find startups and the people within those startups doing things you want to be doing (via startup events or on LinkedIn) and ask if they would be open to being a mentor. Maybe it leads to an internship or a job. Be willing to do something for the startup in return for the time they are spending mentoring you. Another option is to go to hackathons and post about what you did and what you learned.

### 4. What kind of person makes a successful entrepreneur?

A startup founder needs to be able to fail quickly and pivot, handle endless rejection and valid criticism, and cope with loneliness, scorn and financial difficulties. Startup life is not easy for a founder. There is a difference between a founder and an employee. A founder does not quit. They grind it out with tenacity and a “make it happen” attitude all day every day, suffer silently at night trying to figure out how to keep the lights on, and pull it together to start every day fresh again with new zeal. Employees will quit as soon as there isn’t a paycheck.

## Jack Martin, Sales Manager @ [**Aetos Imaging**](https://aetosimaging.com/)

### 1. What is the name of your startup, and what does it do?

Aetos Imaging. We 3D capture mechanical spaces in commercial real estate buildings utilizing Matterport Capture Services and use that to build customized training courses specific to the space. This helps maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of the workforce at that particular facility.

### 2. Why do you like to call Atlanta the home of your startup?

Atlanta has become a major hub for tech companies and especially tech startups in the last 5-10 years. We are fortunate enough to call Atlanta Tech Village our homebase. ATV has allowed us to be around like minded individuals, and feel like we are a part of something larger than ourselves. Sure there are individual companies working out of ATV, but the sense of community is very real and the collaborative mindset is tangible.

### 3. How can high school or college students get involved in the startup world?

One of the main ways that a high school or college student can get involved in the startup world is through job/intern fairs. Most tech hubs will have at least one if not many intern events that you can sign up for.

### 4. What kind of person makes a successful entrepreneur?

People, Passion, and Poise are the 3 P’s I like to bring up when asked what makes a successful entrepreneur.

First and foremost you need to be a people person. It has been proven that potential clients buy from people they like and trust, so the soft skills that you have are extremely important. It’s not everything, but in most cases good soft skills will at least get your foot in the door.

Secondly, the passion you have for your product/business needs to be almost obsessive. It’s not always a glamorous process, there will be days where you work from 6 AM to Midnight, you will work weekends, and there will be times when you have to prioritize your work over your personal life. It’s an absolute grind, but to be able to see your work directly impact the trajectory of the company is a feeling I have yet to feel while working at larger corporations/businesses.

Poise is a tough one, it’s something that is normally learned and not something that people are born with. In the startup world, you have to be ready to pivot at a moment's notice. There are going to be times when you think you have it figured out only to realize one piece of this giant puzzle won’t fit, and then it’s back to the drawing board. You start to see that there is no finish line in entrepreneurship, even when you have a great product you still find ways to see improvements and ways to evolve.

## Conclusion

Thanks again to Michael Caplovitz and Jack Martin for their insightful answers. We hope you learned about the intersection of business and tech that startups represent. Thank you for reading and we hope you have a great day!

Signing off,

### `Sam`
